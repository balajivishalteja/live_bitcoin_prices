# live_bitcoin_prices

Run it as:
python3 nbc_assessment.py <path_directory>
  
I started by requesting bitcoin prices data and then converted the data to json format.

I parsed the data and filtered the data at 00:00:00 and stored it in a dictionary and calculated the required fields

I stored the results and appended it to a empty list to output the result in JSON format
